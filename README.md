## Overview

It is possible that you’ve once heard something along the lines of "moving fast and breaking things" or "test quickly and standardize later.” While not questioning the imminent advantages of winning a race to market, this approach leaves many organizations with Ad Hoc automation solutions that over time turn into an unscalable system that very few people can get their hands dirty with.

These circumstances, combined with an ever-growing number of test cases, builds, features, and systems, often result in teams struggling to find a robust and repeatable way to test their software products.

The solution I propose is a system I’ve come across while searching for simplicity and getting things done in an easy and repeatable fashion. No unnecessary complications and no over-engineering.

In this document, I will focus on identifying the core problem from the symptoms and demonstrate how a well-designed QA Strategy and Architecture can deliver consistent, future-proof results ensuing the following standards:
- Easy and repeatable setups
- Versatile automation scenarios
- Scalable and distributed

## Problem Definition

Picture this: a developer commits code changes to the central repository several times a day. Every commit is then automatically verified by building the application and running automated tests to detect any errors as early as possible.

This is a scenario many IT professionals know well. Despite the simplicity of the concept, Continuous Integration (CI) is not as universally practiced as one might think. Achieving this level of seamless integration and automation is often easier said than done; and in reality, many organizations struggle with several issues that prevent them from realizing this ideal workflow.

### Core Problems:
- **Fragmented Automation:** Automation efforts are disjointed, with different teams working in silos using various frameworks and tools.
- **Limited Accessibility:** Only a few people understand and can maintain the siloed automation efforts, creating dependencies and bottlenecks.
- **Scalability Challenges:** The fragmented nature of automation makes it difficult to scale tests and environments efficiently.
- **Inflexibility in Architecture:** Current setups are not easily repeatable or adaptable, complicating the ability to build and tear down environments as needed.

## Solution

To address these challenges, I’ve developed a comprehensive architecture that leverages Jenkins, Ansible, Ubuntu, LXD containers, and Robot Framework. This combination of technologies provides a scalable, standardized, and flexible automation architecture, ensuring that teams can work cohesively, regardless of their preferred frameworks or languages. The solution is designed to break down silos and enable easy scalability and adaptability in automated testing.

## Architecture Overview

The QA Automation Architecture is designed to create a unified and efficient automated testing workflow:

- **Jenkins:** Acts as the central automation server, managing the execution and reporting of test suites through pipelines.
- **Ansible:** Automates the configuration management of a distributed Jenkins cluster, making the environments consistent, repeatable, and distributed.
- **Ubuntu:** Serves as the consistent operating system for all environments, providing stability and reliability.
- **LXD Containers:** Provides isolated, scalable environments for test execution. Containers allow efficient parallel execution and can be easily created and destroyed, enabling flexible scaling.
- **Robot Framework:** Its flexibility in supporting various test libraries and tools (APIs, Backend, UIs) ensures that it can accommodate different testing needs across teams.

## Key Features

- **Robustness:** Scale easily and handle an increasing number of test cases and isolated environments.
- **Seamlessness:** From setup to teardown, everything is automated. Centralized test monitoring and execution streamline the process, allowing teams to focus on higher-value tasks while the architecture handles routine operations.
- **Versatility:** The system supports a wide range of automation frameworks and languages, making it flexible enough to accommodate various needs.

## Results

- **Code Coverage:** Increased from 70% to 85%, driven by Robot Framework.
- **Defect Discovery Rate:** Increased by 30%, as more comprehensive and faster test executions allowed for quicker identification of issues in each testing cycle.
- **Total Execution Time:** Reduced by 40%, from 4 hours to 2.4 hours, thanks to parallel execution in LXD containers.
- **Average Test Duration:** Decreased by 20%, from 5 minutes to 4 minutes, due to optimized test environments and efficient resource allocation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Ubuntu 24.04**: The host machine running Ubuntu 24.04.
- **LXD**: LXD must be installed and configured to manage the container environments.
- **Jenkins**: Jenkins needs to be installed on the master node.
- **Ansible**: Ansible is required for automating the setup of Jenkins and the container environments.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/isaac-maya/qa-automation-arch.git
   cd qa-automation-arch
   ```
#### 2. **Setup LXD Environment**

LXD is used to manage containers where the test environments will run. To set up LXD:

Initialize LXD: Run the following command to initialize LXD. This step configures LXD with default settings.
```
sudo lxd init
```

Verify LXD Installation: Ensure that LXD is properly installed and initialized by checking the version:

```
lxd --version
```

#### **3. Prepare Jenkins Master Node**

Inventory Configuration: The inventory/hosts file defines the Jenkins master and agent nodes. Ensure that the hosts file reflects the correct IP addresses and hostnames for your environment.

```
[jenkins_master]
jenkins-controller ansible_host=<JENKINS_MASTER_IP>

[jenkins_agents]
jenkins-agent-1 ansible_host=<AGENT_1_IP>
jenkins-agent-2 ansible_host=<AGENT_2_IP>
```

Install Jenkins: Use the Ansible playbook to install Jenkins on the master node. This playbook (jenkins-controller.yml) installs Jenkins, configures the necessary plugins, and sets up the initial admin user.
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts jenkins-controller.yml
```
Verify Jenkins Installation: After running the playbook, verify that Jenkins is accessible by navigating to http://<jenkins-master-ip>:8080. Ensure that the Jenkins UI is up and running.

#### **4. Configure Jenkins Agents**

Jenkins agents run the test jobs in isolated LXD containers. To set up the agents:

Run the Agent Setup Playbook: The jenkins-agent.yml playbook configures each agent node, installs necessary dependencies, and registers the agents with the Jenkins master.
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts jenkins-agent.yml
```

Verify Agent Registration: Check the Jenkins UI to ensure that the agents are listed under Manage Jenkins > Nodes. Each agent should show as online.

#### **5. Configure LXD Containers for Testing**

The playbooks also automate the creation of LXD containers that will serve as test environments:

Create and Launch Containers: The playbook will create LXD containers based on the configurations in the lxd/ directory. Each container is prepared with the necessary tools and dependencies to run Robot Framework tests.
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts lxd-container-setup.yml
```
Publish Container Images: Once the containers are set up, they can be published as reusable images for future test runs. This ensures consistency across test environments.
```
lxc publish <container_name> --alias robot-framework-api-base-image
```

#### **6. Run Initial Test Job**

Access Jenkins Dashboard: Log in to the Jenkins dashboard, and navigate to your test job.
Run the Job: Trigger the job to start the testing process. The tests will be executed in the LXD containers, and the results will be reported back to Jenkins.
Review Results: Once the test job completes, review the results in the Jenkins dashboard to verify that the setup is working as expected.
Usage

To use the QA Automation Architecture for your projects:

Set Up New Projects: Create new Jenkins jobs for your specific testing needs. Use the predefined templates to ensure consistency across projects.
Manage Test Environments: Use the LXD container setup scripts to manage your test environments. Containers can be easily created, destroyed, and managed based on your testing requirements.
Execute Tests: Trigger test jobs from Jenkins. Monitor the execution and results directly within the Jenkins UI.
Scale as Needed: The architecture is designed to scale. Add more Jenkins agents or LXD containers to handle increased testing loads.
